 * The following code below hides the loading animation for all Disqus 2012 ("new Disqus") websites. This code
 * can break at any time, and if it does I would appreciate it if you would contact me by emailing
 * michael@techmansworld.com
 *
 * This style is intended to be applied across all sites with Disqus installed. If you
 * wish for this CSS mod to be narrowed down to only a certain website, feel free to
 * let me know.

 * Btw - Don't remove the next commented set below

css-mods
========

CSS hacks that I created to be used with Stylish. I usually leave CSS comments at the top with the URL the code was posted to.

*Note*: Almost all of these styles were created somewhere 2012-2014, back when I was a lot younger. I keep these here for the sake of history.

If you do encounter an issue with a CSS mod, or wish to request a custom CSS style, you can contact me by email or find me on IRC. You can also choose to file a GitHub issue.

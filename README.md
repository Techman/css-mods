css-mods
========

CSS hacks that I created to be used with [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus). I usually leave CSS comments at the top with the URL the code was posted to.

*Note*: Almost all of these styles were created somewhere 2012-2014, back when I was a lot younger. I keep these here for the sake of history.
